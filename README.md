# Hymnal Search

My dad runs evening prayer services for his church in Tongaat, South Africa.

Part of the service preparation includes choosing hymns that relate to the days bible readings or psalms. 

What I want to do is create an API which a verse or paragraph can be provided as an input, and the hymns with the most semantic similarity are returned in response.

The project invovles ingesting the hymn books that my dad uses.
